    "The synchronization of the activity from distinct brain areas has been proposed to be one of the mechanisms by which them integrate while processing similar inputs in order to exchange information or encode the stimulus (Buzsaki G.,2006; Fries P., 2015). Based on this hypothesis, the time-course of the functional connectivity (dFC) can be measured from brain signals using metrics that capture their phase-relation such as the cross-spectra, the phase-locking value (PLV), and the coherence (Bastos A.M., Schoffelen J.M. 2006).\n",

    "If the hypothesis is that sync holds relevant information for, as an example, stimuli encoding. Then the functional connectivity (FC) can be estimated by measuring the phase coupling (PLV) or phase-amplitude coupling (coherence). The figure bellow from Bastos A.M., Schoffelen J.M. 2006 classifies the functional connectivity metrics accordingly to two major critea of being **directed** or **undirected**, and for each of these if they are model-free or model based.\n",
